# Autonomous Bumper Cars

## Introduction
The age-old carnival game has fallen out of favor, but it can be brought into the 21st century.  Some of the bumper cars will be fully autonomous, and they will do their best to avoid getting hit by the human drivers.  To make things more interesting, the human drivers will get a reward for hitting an autonomous car, while the autonomous car will get a reward for avoiding the human driver.

## Project Goal
-- Describe here which autonomous navigation challenge you want to solve

## Level of Autonomy
-- From 1 to 5, and opportunities to deploy the solution (a target market as example)

## Description
-- Be as specific as possible and use diagrams.
-- Lane following with collision avoidance, solving intersections, etc.
-- System overview
-- Present a tentative architecture of the application or diagram to describe your system.  Something can easily describe what the system does.  Inputs, processing, outputs.

## Related Work
-- Mention any projects that inspired this project; do research about other current solutions that can help you

## Software and Development Tools
We will share a private GitHub repository and use it to plan, design, code and document our progress.

## Milestones
### 8 March 2021
Environment set up with arbitrary number of vehicles present (vehicles may be operated by robots or humans)
### 22 March 2021
Robots can identify other vehicles and plot course to avoid all other vehicles
### 5 April 2021
Robots can predict movement by other vehicles and incorporate expected movement into avoidance plan
### 19 April 2021
Some of the robots may be deployed with the desire to hit other vehicles
### 3 May 2021
